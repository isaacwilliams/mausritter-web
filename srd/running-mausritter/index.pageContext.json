Be on the lookout for opportunities to remind the players of the **small-scale characters** they are playing.\n\n### Create situations, not plots\n\nLet the players **find their own adventure**. Don’t railroad them onto a particular path. Give the players the space to choose the challenges they are interested in.\n\n### Present the world honestly\n\nAs the GM, you are the **eyes, ears and nose** of the players and their mice. Don’t unnecessarily hide things from your players. Make sure they have all the information they need to make meaningful choices.\n\nMake the world a **consistent**, understandable place. Don’t shy away from magic and weirdness, but maintain a logic behind it that can be decoded.\n\nBe an **impartial arbiter** of the rules of the game and the world. Let the dice fall as they may. Follow the goals and actions of antagonists to their logical conclusion.\n\n### Telegraph danger\n\nGive the players ample **warning** of the **dangers** they face. Make traps obvious, deadly puzzles. Give warning of the dangerous beasts that hunt the mice.\n\nDon’t pull your punches.\n\nThe only way for danger to be meaningful is if the outcome of failure is meaningful. When the players face off against dangerous foes, or fall into a deadly trap, do not shy away from the consequences.\n\n### Reward bravery\n\nWhen the players have been smart and brave and followed good leads, give them the **rewards** they have earned. Don’t be miserly when the players face down great dangers and succeed.\n\n## Asking for a Save\n\nSaves should only be asked for as the result of a player’s action or choice. Mice can do anything that seems reasonable and safe, but when they do something dangerous, ask for Save to avoid the possible consequences.\n\n- **STR Saves:** avoid harm through physical power and endurance\n- **DEX Saves:** avoid harm through quick reaction, speed and agility\n- **WIL Saves:** avoid harm through strength of will and force of personality\n\n### Consequences of failure\n\nThe consequences of a failed Save should obvious and telegraphed. Remember that Saves should only occur when a player wants to avoid a negative outcome.\n\nSome options for consequences are:\n\n- **Damage:** ranging from d4 to d20. d4 is minor, d6 is dangerous. d8 is enough to seriously injure a Level 1 character. d20 damage is rare but deadly.\n- **Condition:** Exhausted or Frightened are good options.\n- **Lost time:** Each action takes a Turn. Lost time can burn torches and cause random encounter rolls.\n- **Loss of random item:** Roll d6 for inventory slot.\n- **Mark usage on item:** Mark 1-3 usage dots.\n\n## Luck rolls\n\nLuck rolls are for events that have an unpredictable outcome is outside the remit of a STR, DEX or WIL Save. Assign an ‘X-in-6’ chance to the outcome occurring (low for unlikely, high for likely), then roll a d6. If the result is equal to or less than the chance, it happens.\n\n## Rulings\n\nThe rules of Mausritter will not cover every situation you and the players come across, and some parts have been kept intentionally vague.\n\nWhen this happens, **adapt** one of your existing tools to the purpose, or **create** a new one. Make a note of the ruling for future use.\n\n## Exploration and time\n\nWhen **exploring** in a dungeon or **adventure site**, a party of mice can perform **one major action per Turn**. Major actions are things like moving to a new room, examining a trap or engaging in a fight.\n\nTo easily record Turns, use the **Turn tracker** on the GM Session sheet. Each time the party performs a major action, mark the next empty box. When a double-outlined box is marked, roll for an encounter.\n\n## Overland travel\n\nWhen traveling in the wilderness, the mice can travel a single one-mile hex per Watch. Hexes containing difficult terrain (streams, human roads, large rocks, hills, etc.) require two Watches to cross.\n\n### Rest\n\nIf the mice do not spend at least one Watch per day resting, give them an Exhausted Condition.\n\n### Weather\n\nRoll 2d6 for weather each day.\n\nWeather that is highlighted are poor conditions for travel. For each Watch spent traveling under these conditions, a mouse must make a STR save or gain an Exhausted Condition.\n\n| 2d6  | Spring           | Summer           | Autumn          | Winter          |\n| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| 2    | Rain storm       | Thunder storm    | Wild winds      | Snow storm      |\n| 3-5  | Drizzle          | Very hot         | Heavy rain      | Sleet           |\n| 6-8  | Overcast         | Clear, hot       | Cool            | Bitter cold     |\n| 9-11 | Bright and sunny | Pleasantly sunny | Patchy rain     | Overcast        |\n| 12   | Clear and warm   | Beautifully warm | Clear and crisp | Clear and crisp |\n\n## Encounters\n\nWhen the mice are exploring a dungeon or **adventure site**, roll for encounters **every three Turns**, or whenever they create noise or mayhem that could draw attention.\n\nWhen they are exploring the **wilderness**, roll for encounters at the start of the **Morning** Watch and the start of the **Evening** watch. If an encounter occurs, roll d12 to find what hour it occurs in.\n\nTo roll a random encounter, **roll d6**. On a 1, an **encounter** occurs. On a 2, an **omen** occurs (signs or hints of an encounter).\n\n### Encounter tables\n\nFor each major area, prepare a table of d6 encounters that express the theme of that area. Give each entry something they are already doing as the players arrive.\n\n- Entries 1-3 should be variations of a common encounter.\n- Entries 4-5 should be variations of an uncommon encounter, something slightly unusual.\n- Entry 6 should be a dangerous or weird encounter.\n\n### Reactions\n\nWhen the mice encounter a creature whose reaction to the party is not obvious, you may roll on the following table for their disposition.\n\n| 2d6  | Reaction                                     |\n| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| 2    | **Hostile.** How have the mice angered them? |\n| 3-5  | **Unfriendly.** How can they be appeased?    |\n| 6-8  | **Unsure.** What could win them over?        |\n| 9-11 | **Talkative.** What could they trade?        |\n| 12   | **Helpful.** How can they help the mice?     |\n\n### Morale\n\nWhenever an antagonist is in a battle with the mice and reaches one of the following conditions, it must make a WIL save. On failure, the creature must flee or surrender.\n\n- Is obviously outmatched at the start of a battle\n- Takes critical damage for the first time\n- Sees an ally flee or fall\n","filename":"20-running-mausritter.md"},"downloadUrl":"/srd/mausritter-srd-2.3.md"}}
