They form the core of most Mausritter adventures.\n\nDesigning a good adventure site is more art than science, but these steps will help as a basic guide.\n\nUse the [Adventure Site Generator to create an instant adventure](https://mausritter.com/adventure-site)!\n\n### 1. Create a theme\n\nThe theme of the adventure site is the overall idea that guides its creation. Think of it like the title card and one-sentence description that will guide the rest of your choices.\n\n### 2. Choose factions and goals\n\nA good adventure site will be populated with at least two factions of creatures. These are not necessarily the factions working at your hexcrawl level, though these should inform your choices. The factions should have competing goals they are trying to achieve within the adventure site. Not all of the creatures within the adventure site will be part of these factions.\n\nOne of the factions in the site may already be clear from rolling the Denizens in the adventure site overview. The other faction could be protecting the site from that faction, or competing for a similar goal.\n\n### 3. Draw a map\n\nDraw or find a map of the location, then divide it into ‘rooms’ — these can be actual rooms, or just sensible dividing lines within a larger space.\n\nThe map doesn’t have to be pretty, detailed or to scale. You can just draw the rooms with boxes, and connect them with lines.\n\nKeep these principles in mind when creating a map:\n\n- **Multiple paths** give the players decision points while navigating the space. Create loops and links to other paths.\n- **Varied paths** create distinct areas within the site. Stairs, ramps and cliffs break up the flow of a level and create more variety when navigating the space. Secrets paths reward players who are paying close attention.\n- **Multiple entrances**, (even hidden ones) create opportunities to approach problems from a different angle.\n- **History and ruination** have dramatic impacts on a space. Hint at changes left by previous inhabitants.\n\n### 4. Stock rooms\n\nFor each room within the adventure site, roll or choose the type and contents. A good adventure site will provide a diverse set of challenges through a variety of room types. Some rooms will be obvious, so just go with what seems right. Others may need some random prodding.\n\n### 5. Create an encounter table\n\nBased on the factions you’ve chosen, and the rooms stocked, create a table of d6 encounters for the adventure site.\nEncounters can be dangerous, but are not necessarily hostile to the player mice. Give each entry something it is already doing as the players arrive.\n\n- Entries 1-3 should be variations of a common encounter.\n- Entries 4-5 should be variations of an uncommon encounter, something slightly unusual.\n- Entry 6 should be a strange or dangerous encounter.\n\n## Adventure site theme\n\n### History\n\n#### Construction\n\n| d20 | Construction                     |\n| --- | -------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Ancient bat cult temple          |\n| 2   | Long-abandoned watchtower        |\n| 3   | Noblemouse’s country manor       |\n| 4   | Hidden winter storehouse         |\n| 5   | Burial site of ancient mice      |\n| 6   | Warren dug by rabbits or foxes   |\n| 7   | Human house or other building    |\n| 8   | Sewer or drainage pipes          |\n| 9   | Claustrophobic ant-dug tunnels   |\n| 10  | Massive tree, carved out by mice |\n| 11  | Wizard’s tower                   |\n| 12  | Settlement’s grain mill          |\n| 13  | Rat King’s nest                  |\n| 14  | Skeleton of a great beast        |\n| 15  | Witch’s academy                  |\n| 16  | Gatehouse to faerie realm        |\n| 17  | Deep mine                        |\n| 18  | Bandit’s hideout                 |\n| 19  | Natural cave                     |\n| 20  | Mouse settlement                 |\n\n#### Ruination\n\n| d12 | Ruination               |\n| --- | ----------------------- |\n| 1   | Flooding                |\n| 2   | Magical mishap          |\n| 3   | Age and rot             |\n| 4   | Human destruction       |\n| 5   | Overrun by mold         |\n| 6   | Shifted between realms  |\n| 7   | Attacked by great beast |\n| 8   | Disastrous storm        |\n| 9   | Haunting spirits        |\n| 10  | Mysterious abandonment  |\n| 11  | Internal warfare        |\n| 12  | Disease                 |\n\n### Denizens\n\n#### Inhabitants...\n\n| d10 | Inhabitants...                        |\n| --- | ------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Mice, driven mad or desperate         |\n| 2   | Mice, magically altered               |\n| 3   | Rat bandits                           |\n| 4   | Creatures from a distant land         |\n| 5   | Original residents, strangely twisted |\n| 6   | Ghostly spirits                       |\n| 7   | Faerie advance guard                  |\n| 8   | Foul-tempered snake                   |\n| 9   | Infestation of insects                |\n| 10  | Cat lord and their servants           |\n\n#### Searching for or protecting\n\n| d8  | ...searching for/protecting           |\n| --- | ------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | A safe place to live or hide          |\n| 2   | Cache of fine food                    |\n| 3   | Lost family or friend                 |\n| 4   | Ancient, valuable artworks            |\n| 5   | The last scraps in a picked-over ruin |\n| 6   | Rare alchemical mushrooms             |\n| 7   | Strange and powerful spell            |\n| 8   | Vast horde of pips                    |\n\n### Secret\n\n| d6  | Secret                              |\n| --- | ----------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Monolith humming with arcane energy |\n| 2   | Preserved precursor beast           |\n| 3   | Signs of human experimentation      |\n| 4   | Forgotten grave of an ancient queen |\n| 5   | Path into the veins of the earth    |\n| 6   | Portal to faerie realm              |\n\n## Randomly stocking rooms\n\nTo randomly stock a room in an adventure site, roll d6 three times; the first result shows the room type, the second shows if a creature is present, and the third shows if treasure can be found here.\n\n### Room type\n\n| d6  | Type     |\n| --- | -------- |\n| 1-2 | Empty    |\n| 3   | Obstacle |\n| 4   | Trap     |\n| 5   | Puzzle   |\n| 6   | Lair     |\n\n### Room has a creature?\n\n| d6  | Empty | Obstacle | Trap | Puzzle | Lair |\n| --- | ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |\n| 1   | X     | X        | X    | X      | X    |\n| 2   | X     | X        |      |        | X    |\n| 3   | X     |          |      |        | X    |\n| 4   |       |          |      |        | X    |\n| 5   |       |          |      |        | X    |\n| 6   |       |          |      |        |      |\n\n### Room has treasure?\n\n| d6  | Empty | Obstacle | Trap | Puzzle | Lair |\n| --- | ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |\n| 1   | X     | X        | X    | X      | X    |\n| 2   |       |          | X    | X      | X    |\n| 3   |       |          |      | X      | X    |\n| 4   |       |          |      | X      | X    |\n| 5   |       |          |      | X      |      |\n| 6   |       |          |      |        |      |\n\n### Creatures and lairs\n\nThe creatures used in your adventure site should be populated from the factions you’ve already chosen, but don’t be afraid to include some other creatures too.

Use up the players resources, highlight special equipment or push them to explore further.\n\n| d8  | Obstacle                                                                                                          |\n| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Locked door. Key can be found in another room. Knocking the door down takes time and makes noise.                 |\n| 2   | Steep climb. Without special equipment, mice risk exhaustion or falling.                                          |\n| 3   | Room with an exit in the centre of the roof, 6\" away from any wall.                                               |\n| 4   | Device that creates an high-pitched scream. Each Turn spent here or in adjacent rooms gives Frightened Condition. |\n| 5   | Caved-in section of tunnel, leaving a gap too small to crawl through.                                             |\n| 6   | Tunnel completely filled with water.                                                                              |\n| 7   | Wide, deep puddle of mud blocking the way. Gives an Exhausted Condition per 6\" traveled.                          |\n| 8   | Long, smooth, upwards sloping metal or plastic tube.                                                              |\n\n### Traps\n\nTraps should be obvious and deadly. A good trap has a clear danger and multiple, non-obvious solutions. Consider the purpose the trap was built for, and how it is navigated by other creatures in the site. If the players use a risky method to bypass the trap, call for a Save or Luck roll.\n\n| d8  | Trap                                                                                                                    |\n| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | Large stone door, chiseled loose from frame. Device behind the door tips it forward when handle is turned.              |\n| 2   | Long hallway flooded with water, electrified by large battery in an alcove.                                             |\n| 3   | Dark room filled with noxious, explosive gas. Distinct smell of rotten eggs. d20 damage if ignited.                     |\n| 4   | Thin thread stretched across deadly fall. Safe if traveling slowly, one at a time.                                      |\n| 5   | Pit blocking the way. A snake is asleep at the bottom.                                                                  |\n| 6   | Door with three handles in the shape of mushrooms, one safe, the others poison. Poison handles deal d12 magical damage. |\n| 7   | Circle of enchanted mushrooms, with a young mouse inside.
