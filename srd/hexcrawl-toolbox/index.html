Fill hexes\n\nStart with a 5x5 map of **one-mile hexes**. Place a friendly **settlement** in the centre.\n\nFill the remaining hexes. Roll on the **hex contents** tables or use them as inspiration. Write a one-line description for each hex.\n\n### 2. Create factions (Optional)\n\n**Factions** are the major powers within your hex crawl. They help set the stakes of the players choices, and create the feeling of a living world going on outside of the game sessions.\n\n### 3. Detail adventure sites\n\n**Adventure sites** are the dangerous places where brave adventurers find the wealth they seek. Where settled mice, more careful and less desperate, do not dare to scurry.\n\nPick 2-4 of the of the landmarks and detail them as adventure sites. Spread them out, to give the players good reasons to criss-cross the map.\n\nDecide the **theme** for each, then **fully detail** one of them. You can detail the others now, or wait until the players are closer to encountering them.\n\n### 4. Seed rumours\n\nCreate a table of **d6 rumours**. As the players explore adventure sites or rest in settlements, use this table to give **hints** of other locations and of the activities of factions within the hexcrawl.\n\n- Entries 1-3 should be true\n- Entries 4-5 should partially true\n- Entry 6 should be false\n\n### 5. Create encounter table\n\nBased on the factions you’ve chosen and other inhabitants of the area, create a table of **d6 encounters**.\n\n## Running a hexcrawl\n\n### First session\n\nIn the first session, pick one of the adventure sites you’ve detailed and start the players at the entrance.\n\nGive the players a reason why they should care about the adventure site. Use the backgrounds of their mice and theme of the adventure site as hooks, or use the table below if you’re stuck for ideas.\n\n| d6 | Starting adventure site hook                      |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Searching for a lost family member                |\n| 2  | Investigating on orders of a noblemouse           |\n| 3  | Mouse wizard requires a certain spell component   |\n| 4  | Site is lair of a creature harassing a settlement |\n| 5  | Following an inherited treasure map               |\n| 6  | Seeking shelter from a terrible storm             |\n\n### Exploring the map\n\nOnce the players are done exploring the adventure site, or need to retreat back to a friendly place for supplies, show them a **blank version** of your map.\n\nMark the **friendly settlement** and the **adventure site**, plus a couple of other well-known places.\n\nAllow the players to find their own way through the map. As the party of mice move through each hex, they should automatically encounter the major landmarks you’ve created, as long as they are fairly obvious.\n\n### Expanding the map\n\nAs the players uncover new leads and the world changes around them, create some more adventure sites and start expanding the map.\n\n## Hex contents\n\nFor each hex on your map, roll, choose or invent:\n\n- Hex type\n- Landmark (depending on hex type)\n- An interesting detail for that landmark\n\nWrite a one-line description for each hex.\n\n### Hex type\n\n|   d6   |   Type         |\n|--------|----------------|\n|   1-2  |   Countryside  |\n|   3-4  |   Forest       |\n|   5    |   River        |\n|   6    |   Human town   |\n\n### Landmarks\n\n|   d20  |   Countryside             |   Forest                |   River                   |   Human town            |\n|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n|   1    |   Anthill                 |   Abandoned shack       |   Canal lock              |   Abandoned car         |\n|   2    |   Beech, lightning split  |   Bright clearing       |   Converging tributaries  |   Apartment balcony     |\n|   3    |   Bone-white tree         |   Cascading waterfalls  |   Draping willow          |   Blackberry hedge      |\n|   4    |   Cow skeleton            |   Cliff face            |   Eroded riverbank        |   Busy road             |\n|   5    |   Field of flowers        |   Cold, fresh spring    |   Fallen tree crossing    |   Drainpipe outlet      |\n|   6    |   Field of wheat          |   Dense underbrush      |   High waterfall          |   Dumped furniture      |\n|   7    |   Hedge row               |   Face in ancient oak   |   Huge boulder            |   Greenhouse            |\n|   8    |   Hollow tree stump       |   Fox hole              |   Huge concrete dam       |   Mouse ruins           |\n|   9    |   Huge flat rock          |   Grove of ferns        |   Isolated island         |   Newly built house     |\n|   10   |   Lily-lined pond         |   Hollow tree stump     |   Muddy flats             |   Overgrown garden bed  |\n|   11   |   Massive fallen tree     |   Huge pine tree        |   Rocky rapids            |   Pigeon nest           |\n|   12   |   Old craggy oak          |   Human walking track   |   Row of dead trees       |   Pile of trash         |\n|   13   |   Old farmhouse           |   Human-made clearing   |   Silty dam               |   Rocky riverbed        |\n|   14   |   Quiet dirt road         |   Meandering brook      |   Stepping-stones         |   Shopping trolley      |\n|   15   |   Rabbit warren           |   Overgrown ruins       |   Stone bridge            |   Stagnant pond         |\n|   16   |   Sparrow nest            |   Ring of stones        |   Stony shallows          |   Steel bridge          |\n|   17   |   Stand of pine trees     |   Rocky outcropping     |   Submerged trash         |   Trash-filled skip     |\n|   18   |   Steep hill              |   Sunken hollow         |   Sunken barge            |   Tree-lined footpath   |\n|   19   |   Stone wall              |   Tangle of roots       |   Twisted roots           |   Underground car park  |\n|   20   |   Tangle of fig roots     |   Termite-riddled tree  |   Wooden bridge           |   Woodshed              |\n\n### Landmark details\n\n|   d6  |   d8  |   Detail                                                   |\n|-------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   1   |   -

They help create a feeling of a **living world**.\n\nPick or create 3-4 factions to be the major powers within your hexcrawl.\n\n### Using factions\n\nFactions have goals they are trying to complete and resources they can utilise towards the goal’s completion. Goals should interact with other factions or complete for similar resources.\n\n**Resources** reflect the power and influence of the faction within the world.\n\nEach **goal** requires 2-5 progress marks (eg. ○○) to be completed, depending on its complexity.\n\nFactions with at least three resources are capable of fielding a warband.\n\n### Goal progression\n\n**Between sessions**, each faction will work towards their current goal.\n\n**Roll d6**, then adjust the value:\n\nFor each **relevant resource** the faction has, **add 1** to the result.\n\nIf a rival faction is targeted by the goal, **subtract 1** from the result for each of that faction’s **relevant resources**.\n\n- On final result of **4-5**, mark **1 progress** toward the goal.\n- On a **6+**, mark **2 progress**.\n\nWhen a faction **completes a goal**, add a **new resource** to represent their increased power and influence.\n\nIf the goal reduces another faction’s power and influence, remove or change one of its resources.\n\nAs factions work towards and complete their goals, update your **map** to show waxing and waning power, and add hints of current goals to your **rumour table**.\n\n### Player interference\n\nAs the players interact with factions, show **signs** of the **current goals** they are working towards.\n\nPlayers should have opportunities to interact with the factions, to thwart or help them compete their goals.\n\nFactions may attempt to recruit the help of players and players may interfere with the faction’s progress.\n\nIf the players successfully **help or interfere** in completion of a goal, mark or erase **1-3 progress marks**, depending on the scale of the player interference.\n\nIf players directly attack a faction and significantly affect their power, this may require you to remove or re-write a faction’s resource.\n\n## Example factions\n\n### 1.
