Spells are usually found in deep and dangerous places. The creation of spells is an art lost to all but the most learned wizards, and they guard their secrets closely.\n\n### Selling spells\n\nIf unwanted, a fully charged spell can usually be sold for d6 x 100p in a settlement. A depleted spell’s value is halved.\n\n### Casting a spell\n\nTo cast a spell, your mouse must hold the tablet in a paw and read it aloud.\n\nWhen your mouse casts a spell, decide on the **power** to cast it with, up to the number of usage dots remaining on the spell.\n\nRoll a number of **d6** equal to the **power** the spell is cast with. For each die which shows the **value 4, 5 or 6**, mark one usage on the spell.\n\nThe spell has an **effect**, which varies depending on the number of **[DICE]** invested, and the **[SUM]** of the rolled dice.\n\n### Recharging a spell\n\nWhen a spell’s usage dots are filled, it is **depleted** and cannot be cast. Each spell has a **recharge requirement**. Fulfilling this requirement will coax the spirit back to the spell and **clear all** of its usage dots.\n\n### Miscasts\n\nWhenever **one or more 6s** are rolled when casting a spell, the caster takes **d6 damage to WIL** for each 6 rolled. Then make a WIL save. If failed, take the **Drained** Condition.\n\n## List of spells\n\nRoll on this table of spells as loot, or use these spells as examples for creating your own.\n\n|   2d8  |   Spell           |   Effect                                                                                                                        |   Recharge                                                                                      |\n|--------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2    |   Fireball        |   Shoot a fireball up to 24\".
