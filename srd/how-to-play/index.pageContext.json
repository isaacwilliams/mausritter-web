You describe what your mouse does. The GM will describe the outcome. The conversation flows until the mechanics interject.\n\n## Role-playing\n\nYou are in control of—and acting in the role of—your mouse. You can talk in first, second or third person, or switch between them. You don’t have to do a silly voice, but it certainly can’t hurt.\n\n## Best practices\n\nIf you’re stuck thinking of what to do when you’re playing Mausritter, refer back to these guidelines.\n\n- **Ask lots of questions.** Make notes. Draw maps.\n- **Work together.** Devise schemes. Recruit allies.\n- **Dice are dangerous.** Clever plans don’t need to roll.\n- **Play to win.** Delight in losing.\n- **Fight dirty.** Run. Die. Roll a new mouse.\n\n## Saves\n\nWhen you describe your mouse doing something **risky** where the outcome is **uncertain** and failure has **consequences**, the GM will ask you to make a save against either STR, DEX or WIL.\n\nTo make a save, roll a d20. If the result is **less than or equal** to the relevant attribute, your mouse succeeds, and suffers no consequences. If the result is over the attribute, your mouse fails, and suffers the consequences described by the GM.\n\n### Opposed saves\n\nIf your mouse and another character are competing, you both make saves. The **lowest successful roll** wins.\n\n### Advantage and Disadvantage\n\nIf you roll a save and are particularly well prepared or equipped, the GM may allow you to roll with **Advantage**. Roll **2d20** and take the **lowest** result.\n\nThe GM may ask you to roll with **Disadvantage** if you are in bad position or poorly equipped for your current task. Roll **2d20** and take the **highest** result.\n\n## Combat\n\nCombat is dangerous business for mice, even brave adventurers. But sometimes it cannot be avoided.\n\nIf you attack **unsuspecting** foes, your mouse and any allies aware of the plan **go first**. Otherwise, make a **DEX save** to act before your opponents. In following combat rounds, maintain this order.\n\nOn your turn in a combat Round, your mouse can **move** up to 12\" and perform an **action**. Actions can anything from negotiating, attacking, fleeing or performing a risky gambit (like tripping or disarming an opponent).\n\n### Attacks\n\n**Attacks always hit.** Roll your weapon’s die and do that much damage to an opponent, minus their armour.\n\nWhen an attack is **impaired**, such is firing into cover, or fighting while grappled, roll **d4** for damage regardless of weapon. When an attack is **enhanced** by a gambit or vulnerable opponent, roll **d12**.\n\n### Hit Protection and damage\n\nDamage is dealt first to a creature’s **Hit Protection** (HP). This represents the creature’s ability to avoid or shrug off real damage.\n\nOnce HP is depleted, damage is dealt to **STR**.\n\nAfter taking STR damage, the creature must make a STR save. If they succeed, they are still able to fight. If they fail, they take critical damage.\n\nWhen a creature takes **critical damage**, they take an **Injured** Condition, and are **incapacitated** until tended to by an ally and take a short rest.\n\nIf an incapacitated creature is left untended for 6 exploration **Turns**, they die.\n\n### Attribute score loss and death\n\nIf a creature has their **STR** reduced to zero, they are **dead**. If **DEX** is reduced to zero, they are **unable to move**. If **WIL** is reduced to zero, they are reduced to **insensibility**.\n\nWhen your mouse **dies**, roll up a new one. The GM should introduce them as soon as possible. Getting back into the game quickly is more important than realism.\n\n## Rest and healing\n\nThere are three ways your mouse can rest and recover.\n\n- **Short rest:** takes 1 Turn. A swig of water and a few minutes of rest will restore **d6+1 HP**.\n- **Long rest:** takes 1 Watch. A meal and some sleep will restore **all HP**. If HP was already full, restore **d6** to an **attribute score**.\n- **Full rest:** takes a week back in safety. This **fully restores** your mouse’s ability scores and removes most long-term Conditions. A week of food and board in a settlement usually costs 20p.\n\n## Time\n\nFor convenience and ease of reference, game time is divided up into three time scales of expanding duration.\n\n- **Round:** the timescale used during **combat**. Each Round is less than a minute.\n- **Turn:** the timescale used during **adventure site exploration**. Each Turn is around 10 minutes, and is enough time to explore one room or perform an action or two. A fight will almost always last one Turn.\n- **Watch:** the timescale used during **wilderness travel**. Each Watch is 36 Turns, about 6 hours. There are 4 watches in a day. You can usually travel 1 hex or mile in a watch.\n\n## Overland travel\n\nYour party of mice can travel **one hex** or mile per **Watch**. **Difficult terrain** (streams, human roads, large rocks, hills, etc.) require **two Watches** per mile traveled.\n\n### Foraging\n\nIn the wild, your mouse can spend a Watch **foraging**.\n\nIf they do, they will find **d3 uses** of **rations**.\n\n## Advancement\n\nYour mouse earns Experience Points (XP) by bringing **treasure** and useful goods back from **places of danger** to the safety of a **mouse settlement**.\n\nFor every pip-worth of treasure brought to safety (divided equally amongst the party), your mouse earns 1 XP.\n\nYour mouse can earn **additional XP** by **spending** their pips **selflessly** on improvements for the whole community. For every 10 pips spent this way, your mouse earns 1 XP.\n\n### Level\n\nMice start at Level 1.\n\nThe following table shows the total XP required to advance each Level.\n\n| Level | Hit Dice | Grit | Experience points |\n| ----- | -------- | ---- | ----------------- |\n| 1     | 1d6      | 0    | 0                 |\n| 2     | 2d6      | 1    | 1000              |\n| 3     | 3d6      | 2    | 3000              |\n| 4     | 4d6      | 2    | 6000              |\n| 5+    | 4d6      | 3    | +5000             |\n\nWhen your mouse earns enough XP to advance to each Level, use the following procedure.\n\n- **Roll for attribute increase:** roll d20 once for each of your mouse’s STR, DEX and WIL. If a result is higher than the attribute’s current value, increase it by one.\n- **Roll Hit Dice:** roll the dice listed for the new Level’s Hit Dice. If the value is higher than your mouse’s current HP, replace your HP with the rolled value. Otherwise, increase your mouse’s HP by 1.\n\n### Grit\n\nStarting at second Level, your mouse has **Grit**. This allows your mouse to **ignore Conditions**.\n\nFor each point of Grit you have, you may place one Condition into the Grit space on your character sheet. Once placed into the Grit space, a Condition cannot be removed until cleared.\n","filename":"13-how-to-play.md"},"downloadUrl":"/srd/mausritter-srd-2.3.md"}}
