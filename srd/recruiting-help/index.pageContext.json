Throughout the mouse kingdoms you’ll come across other mice who are willing to explore the vast unknown world with you and your party.\n\n## Hirelings\n\nIn a mouse settlement, you can spend a day asking around for mice looking for work. The size of the settlement determines what types of hireling are available. Smaller settlements may not have skilled mice looking for work.\n\n### Recruiting hirelings\n\nMake a **WIL save** or **pay** 20p. If successful (or 20p is paid), roll the **Number** for the type of hireling you are interested in employing to determine how many are looking for work.\n\nTypical hirelings will have:  \nd6 hp, STR 2d6, DEX 2d6, WIL 2d6\n\nHirelings have 6 inventory slots: two paw, two body, two pack.\n\n|   Hireling             |   Number  |   Wages/day  |\n|------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n|   Torchbearer          |   d6      |   1p         |\n|   Labourer             |   d6      |   2p         |\n|   Tunnel digger        |   d4      |   5p         |\n|   Armourer/blacksmith  |   d2      |   8p         |\n|   Local guide          |   d4      |   10p        |\n|   Mouse-at-arms        |   d6      |   10p        |\n|   Scholar              |   d2      |   20p        |\n|   Knight               |   d3      |   25p        |\n|   Interpreter          |   d2      |   30p        |\n\n### Hireling morale\n\nWhen a hireling or warband is placed in a **stressful situation**, made to go without pay or food, or asked to do something more **dangerous** than what they signed on for, they must make a **WIL save** or **flee**.\n\nEspecially well-paid or loyal hirelings may make this save with Advantage.\n\n### Hireling advancement\n\nHirelings and warbands can improve in the same way that your player mice do.\n\n- Hirelings who receive a share of treasure gain 1 XP per pip they are given above their daily wage.\n- Warbands who receive share of treasure will gain 1 XP per 10 pips they are given above their weekly wage.\n\nHirelings and warbands advance at the same rate as player mice, so once they get 1000 XP, they advance to Level 2.\n\nNot receiving a share of treasure may cause resentment amongst hirelings.\n\n## Warbands\n\nA mouse is very small, and many beasts cannot be defeated working alone. When mice work together, they can form a warband, and act on a scale capable of facing other warbands or large beasts, like a cat or boar.\n\n### Forming a warband\n\nA warband is formed by 20 or more fighting mice, plus one follower (luggage porter, cook, armourer) for every fighter.\n\nYour mouse can form a warband under their command. In a town or city, spend a week recruiting. Make a WIL save or pay 1000p.\n\nWarbands start with:   \nd6 hp, STR 10, DEX 10, WIL 10  \nDamage: d6 clubs and axes\n\nWarbands require 1000p a week for upkeep and wages. Failure to pay may result in mutiny.\n\n### Battles\n\nBattles between warbands and warband-scale creatures function the same as fights between small individuals. Attacks deal damage to HP, then to STR.\n\nAttacks by a warband against a non-warband scale creature are enhanced, any damage taken from non-warband scale creatures is ignored unless it is particularly destructive or large scale.\n\n### Casualties\n\nWhen a warband takes critical damage, they are broken and cannot act until rallied. At STR 0 the warband is wiped out. At half STR, the warband must make a WIL save or be routed.\n\nWarbands recover HP and attribute score damage like individuals do, with Short, Long and Full rests.\n\n### Equipping\n\nEquipment improves a warband’s abilities the same way as it does for individuals. Just multiply the purchase price by 20.\n\n## Constructions\n\nThe **right to build** on land cannot be bought. It can only be given, or taken and defended.\n\nA team of three tunnel diggers can excavate one 6\" cube of soil per day. Other materials take twice as long.\n\nRooms can be of any size — the following is the cost of materials and fittings per 6\" cube constructed. Labourers and diggers must be paid separately.\n\n| Room                       | Cost  |\n|----------------------------|-------|\n| Tunnel, per 6\"             | 10p   |\n| Poor room, per 6\" cube     | 100p  |\n| Standard room, per 6\" cube | 500p  |\n| Grand room, per 6\" cube    | 2000p |\n\nAll constructions require an **upkeep** of 1% of the total cost per month.\n","filename":"15-recruiting-help.md"}}}
