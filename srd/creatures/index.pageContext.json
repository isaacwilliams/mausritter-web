Magical or highly intelligent creatures may break these rules.\n\n- Other **mice**: Can easily communicate.\n- Other **rodents**: Can speak and communicate, with some difficulty and difference of custom.\n- Other **mammals**: Make a WIL save to see if communication is possible.\n- Otherwise: Can’t directly communicate.\n\n## List of creatures\n\nUse these creatures in your campaign, and as examples for creating new antagonists for your players.\n\nWhen a creature lists critical damage in its stat block, this occurs instead of the standard critical damage effect.\n\n> Example: a spider attacks Burdock the mouse and does 4 damage. The Burdock has 2 HP, so 2 of the damage is passed through to his DEX. Burdock must make a DEX Save, but fails, so the spider quickly wraps the him up in its web and starts to escape. Hopefully Burdock’s friends are quick in their pursuit!\n\n### Cat\n\n:::statblock\n**Warband scale**  \n15hp, STR 15, DEX 15, WIL 10, Armour 1  \nAttacks: d6 swipe, d8 bite\n:::\n\n**Wants** to be served.
