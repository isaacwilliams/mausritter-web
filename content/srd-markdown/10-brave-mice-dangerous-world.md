# Brave mice in a dangerous world

> The mouse kingdoms survive on the edge of collapse. A harsh winter or heartless cat could spell the end for all. The settled mice huddle together, hidden in their settlements in trees and burrows and walls, scraping and saving. A tenuous existence.
> But you are not like those settled mice.
> By choice or by necessity you are an adventurer. You live by your luck, your smarts, your bravery. With your friends by your side, you will abandon the warmth and safety of the mouse settlements and venture forth into the dark and dangerous places where other mice do not dare to tread.
> There is great wealth to be found by those that are willing to take it. The world is old. Great empires of mouse and beast have risen and fallen.
> It's a huge and dangerous world out there. It does not look kindly on a small mouse. But if you are very brave and very clever and just a bit lucky, you might be able to survive. And if you survive long enough, you might even become a hero amongst mice.

## What is Mausritter?

Mausritter is a role-playing game. You and between two and five friends play make-believe to create a shared world. The rules help keep the story you tell consistent, interesting and challenging.

One of you will take on the role of the Game Master (GM). They will invent and describe a consistent, believable world, complete with dangerous antagonists, wild lands, and friendly settlements. They will also act as a neutral referee of the rules, applying them fairly to player mice, along with the non-player characters within the world.

The other players take on the role of the mice. They each play the role of a small, brave and desperate adventurer, delving into dangerous places and exploring the world that the GM describes.

### What is a role-playing game?

Role-playing games are a process of shared, collaborative storytelling and problem solving.
Role-playing games exist mostly as a conversation. The GM will describe a situation, and the players will describe how the mice they control react and interact with it.

At certain points (such as when a mouse does something risky), the rules of the game interject. Dice may be rolled to see what happens. Then the conversation resumes.

## What you need to play

- A character sheet for each player
- A session tracking sheet for the Game Master
- A set of Item and Condition tokens
- Polyhedral gaming dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20)
- Pencils and erasers
- Spare paper for taking notes and sketching maps

### Dice notation

Mausritter uses standard RPG dice notation throughout.

For example:

- d20 means: Roll a single 20-sided die
- 1d8 means: Roll a single 8-sided die
- 3d6 means: Roll three 6-sided dice, add them together

For a d3 or d2, roll a 6-sided die and divide by two or three.
